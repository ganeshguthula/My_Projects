Leveraging Python libraries, I conducted a real-life sales analysis project, employing tools like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SeaBorn for data manipulation and visualization. Through comprehensive data exploration and statistical analysis, actionable business insights were derived, enabling informed decision-making. The project showcases the power of Python in extracting meaningful patterns from sales data, offering a valuable foundation for strategic planning.
